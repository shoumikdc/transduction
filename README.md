# Transduction in Multimode Bosonic Systems
Authors: Shoumik Chowdhury (@shoumikdc) & Mengzhen Zhang; March '19 - Present. 

This is a repo of Mathematica notebooks for implementing the symplectic decoupling and swapping protocols for multimode quantum transduction. See reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02385

### Organization
- (v0) Python scripts with numerical tools for handling symplectic matrices and Groebner bases. 
- (v1) Initial commits with the original notebooks for decoupling. 
- (v2) More sophisticated/structured code for studying transduction in optomechanical systems. 
- (v3) Notebooks to study effective coupling strengths in the decoupling protocol.
